gitadm is a script for assisting in the management of git repositories.  It lets you add public keys to git accounts and it makes creating new repositories easier.

Here's an example of how to create a new repo on the server and populate it with the contents of the current directory:

./gitadm create-repo -s gitserver -r myrepos/stuff.git --use-dir

This also automatically sets up tracking of the master branch for you so that you can use "git pull" and "git push" without arguments.
